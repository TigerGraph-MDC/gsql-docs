= GSQL Style Guide
:description:
:num_rule: footnote:[If you want to use `num` to refer to a quantity, always put it at the beginning]


This page details TigerGraphâ€™s style guide for writing GSQL. The purpose of the styleguide is to make code easy to read and achieve lower cost of maintenance.

== General
* Always write keywords and reserved words in all caps. You can find a list of keywords and reserved words in Query Language Reserved Words and DDL Keywords & Reserved Words.
* If you are storing GSQL statements in a separate file, use the file extension `.gsql`.

== Naming
We separate identifiers into two broad classes: schema object _types_ (graph, vertex, edge, and tuple type) and instances.
Schema types are analogous to classes in an object-oriented language.  Schema object types follow one naming convention, and instances follow another convention, with additional specifications for accumulators.

Identifier naming follows the conventions below:

[cols=",a,a"]
|===
|Identifier type |Style |Example

|Instances
|Use snake case: lowercase, letters connected by underscore
a|* `batch_number`
* `v_type`


|Non-collection accumulators (`SumAccum`, `MinAccum`, `MaxAccum` etc.)
|* Use snake case
* Start with the aggregation type such as sum unless there is an excellent semantic alternative
a|
 * ``@num_fraudsters``{num_rule}

|Collection accumulator
|* Use snake case
* End with container type

|* `@top_result_list`
* `@@property_map`
* `@neighbor_set`


|Vertex type name
|Capitalize initial letters and connect words with underscores.
|* `Person`
* `Medical_Condition`


|Edge type name
|Capitalize initial letters and connect words with underscores.
|* `Diagnosed_By`

|Vertex and edge attribute name
|Use snake case.
|`CREATE VERTEX Genre (PRIMARY_ID genre_id STRING, genre_name STRING)`

|Graph name
|Capitalize initial letters and connect words with underscores.
|* `Social_Net`

|Tuple type name
|Capitalize initial letters and connect words with underscores.
|* `Vertex_Score`
* `Key_Pair`


|Query and loading job name
|Use snake case.
|* `match_users`
* `suggest_products`
* `tg_degree_cent`
|===

== Spacing

=== Block indentation
Indent the body of a block by 4 spaces.
A block is a syntactic structure which may contain multiple statements.
This includes queries, `SELECT`, `IF/ELSE`, `CASE WHEN/THEN`, `FOREACH`, and `WHILE`.
If the body of `ACCUM` or `POST-ACCUM` contains multiple clauses, then use indentation also.
Use spaces instead of tabs, because tab size can vary.

[cols="1h,5a"]

|Recommended |
[.wrap,gsql]
----
CREATE QUERY hello(VERTEX<person> p) {
    Start = {p};
    Result = SELECT tgt
        FROM Start:s -(friendship:e)- person:tgt;
        PRINT Result;
}
----

|Not recommended

[.wrap,gsql]
----
CREATE QUERY hello(VERTEX<person> p) {
Start = {p};
Result = SELECT tgt
         FROM Start:s -(friendship:e)- person:tgt;
PRINT Result;
}
----
|===


=== Line length
Lines should be short enough so that they display without scrolling and can be printed without anything being cut off.
If a line is more than 80 characters, it should be split into multiple lines. The additional lines should be indented, but by 2 spaces only, to show that they are a continuation of the previous line.

[cols="1h,5a"]
|===
|Recommended |
----
CREATE QUERY hello(VERTEX<person> p) {
    Start = {p};
    Result = SELECT tgt
        FROM Start:s -(friendship:e)- person:tgt; //This is a long comment
        PRINT Result; // And it is split into multiple lines.
}
----

|Not recommended

|
----
CREATE QUERY hello(VERTEX<person> p) {
    Start = {p};
    Result = SELECT tgt
        FROM Start:s -(friendship:e)- person:tgt; // This is a really long comment that spans over over a hundred characters. It really should be split into multiple lines instead of crowing one line
    PRINT Result;
}
----
|===

=== Keyword justification
In a `SELECT` block, line up the keywords `FROM`, `SAMPLE`, `WHERE`, `ACCUM`, `POST-ACCUM`, `HAVING`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT`.

{
    SumAccum<int> @activityAmount;
    start = {person.*};
    result = SELECT v FROM start:v -(_>:e)- post:tgt
      ACCUM v.@activityAmount +=1
        HAVING v.@activityAmount >= activityThreshold;
    PRINT result;
}

      ACCUM v.@activityAmount +=1
        HAVING v.@activityAmount >= activityThreshold;
    PRINT result;
}
----
|===


== Comments

* Use `//` for single line and inline comments.
* Use `/\*` at the start and `*/` at the end of multiline comments, with the interior comment lines indented.
* Do not use `#`.
